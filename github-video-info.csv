Take for example, the Equifax breach, when the private data of more than 143 million people became publicly available due to a security vulnerability in an outdated software dependency. Despite the fact that GitHub Security Alerts and other tools allow software developers to check free open-source dependencies, developers still aren't paying enough attention to their security. In this talk, Ivan will discuss the perceptions of developers coming from 25 companies located in nine countries—and will present the insights on their practices, from the selection of software dependencies and updating of software dependencies to automating the dependency-management process and the mitigation of bugs and vulnerabilities in dependencies where a fixed version doesn't exist. Armed with this new knowledge, participants will discover the implications of the most popular dependency-management strategies, and from there will be able to improve the dependency management of their own software projects.GitHub Satellite: A community connected by codeOn May 6th, we threw a free virtual event featuring developers working together on the world’s software, announcements from the GitHub team, and inspiring performances by artists who code.More information: https://githubsatellite.comSchedule: https://githubsatellite.com/schedule/"

Whether you're a hobbyist, an open source maintainer, or an organization, the single truth remains: We can’t buy time. Success is often determined by how efficiently we are using our time. In order to increase our efficiencies, we turned to GitHub Actions to automate our workflows for both the software and hardware we produce. We are now able to reprogram our Arduino board, test the input/output of the hardware, and then send the results back to GitHub Actions. We can completely automate not just a continuous integration of the software but also of the hardware using solely online tools. In this talk, we'll run through the workflows Arduino has implemented with GitHub Actions and show attendees ways that they can take the first steps into bringing GitHub Actions into their development cycle.GitHub Satellite: A community connected by codeOn May 6th, we threw a free virtual event featuring developers working together on the world’s software, announcements from the GitHub team, and inspiring performances by artists who code.More information: https://githubsatellite.comSchedule: https://githubsatellite.com/schedule/"

Did you know that a booklet about innersource is the single most downloaded non-code asset on public GitHub? Since the rise of GitHub Enterprise, companies are increasingly experimenting with innersource inside their firewalls. Seems like a no-brainer, doesn't it? Most long-established companies need more collaboration and full-stack knowledge (and fewer information silos, resulting resource bottlenecks, ""not-invented-here"" re-inventions of the wheel, lack of innovation, and all the other un-necessarily wasteful proprietary practices that contribute to poor quality software and low engineering employee morale). Meanwhile, FOSS developers as a rule feel empowered to ""scratch their own itches"" and therefore suffer from few of these proprietary company woes. But as the FOSS movement has grown, there are cracks in sustainability starting to show in the form of maintainer burnout, lack of sufficient or appropriate corporate support for FOSS, and a real shortage of people willing and able to lead FOSS into the future. So how can innersource help FOSS Sustainability? Learn from someone who is thinking about how to grow the pool of qualified FOSS developers and to improve corporate support for FOSS basically since the term open source was coined. You'll hear about specific actions every developer and every company can take to improve software engineering, whether FOSS or proprietary, and help sustain the precious FOSS ecosystem through the next generation.GitHub Satellite: A community connected by codeOn May 6th, we threw a free virtual event featuring developers working together on the world’s software, announcements from the GitHub team, and inspiring performances by artists who code.More information: https://githubsatellite.comSchedule: https://githubsatellite.com/schedule/"

This is an excuse to not write documentation or justify the absence of it. In my work with many teams, the lack of documentation is often a symptom of high technical debt.What if we could turn this around and use documentation like a driver for positive culture change and start paying the critical technical debt? This approach not only helps teams to faster identify areas that need critical support but also brings more empathy to the table.In this talk, Tania draws on experiences using documentation as a weapon for positive culture and process change in machine learning and scientific computing environments. She focuses on the processes and approaches that enable the creation of documentation for data scientists, infrastructure, and software engineering teams, and clients.By the end of the talk, you'll learn efficient techniques to make documentation a first-class citizen in your development cycles—and leave with one or two tricks to convince even the most reluctant developer to document code.About GitHub Universe:GitHub Universe is a two-day conference dedicated to the creativity and curiosity of the largest software community in the world.

They examined 10,000 open source Java components that were published to Maven Central and hosted on GitHub. They combined team and project performance metrics from GitHub, popularity data from Maven Central, and vulnerability and dependency data from Sonatype to examine what properties are shared by exemplary open source teams. They discuss these findings, including the differences we see between exemplary small teams and large teams, the fact that popularity does not predict security, and how remarkably difficult it is to keep dependencies patched while being “almost” up-to-date. They also highlight the organizational and technology practices they observe among exemplar open source teams, which release new versions 2x more frequently and remediate security vulnerabilities 3x more quickly, all while delivering a level of value that makes them standouts in terms of popularity and adoption.About GitHub Universe:GitHub Universe is a two-day conference dedicated to the creativity and curiosity of the largest software community in the world.

They mustered the patience and the energy to teach Git to yours truly. They did it in stages: they started by how to clone a repository and how to check out its branches, taught me about remotes and how to create my own branches, how to commit my changes, and the etiquette of good commit messages. One glorious day, they decided I was ready to push to a remote repository. By golly I felt powerful. I had mastered Git's mysteries!Becoming familiar with Git's basic concepts and commands took the best part of 2 years, but it was worth every minute. As a designer, learning Git made me more resilient, more independent and more useful to my development team. Learning Git made me a better designer.In this talk, I will try to convince developers that they should invest time and effort in teaching Git to the designers they work with, what they have to gain from it, and how to go about it.

(Yes.) Not soon after, Microsoft launched an AI chatbot experiment, called Tay, which shut down when the software began spewing hateful speech online. One of the known fears of AI and machine learning is the notion of algorithmic bias, which can create or indirectly allow machines to learn prejudiced behavior. In this talk, we will explore what it really means to “teach” a computer to have prejudices, and what can happen product managers, designers, and engineers are not cognizant of their own biases. Appropriate for both technical and non-technical audiences. What Attendees Can Expect to Learn: Examples of “bad” computing, how personal beliefs and prejudice can manifest in code and product development, and ways to avoid personal bias in algorithms and products.About GitHub Universe:GitHub Universe is a two-day conference dedicated to the creativity and curiosity of the largest software community in the world.

This is true, but at this level, not very actionable. Over our years of building and deploying tools to development teams, we have found that providing the right tools can act as a catalyst for positive culture change. When you provide the right tools to your development teams at scale, you show that you’re serious about changing the way they work. When you help teams learn and master the modern practices that the tools enable, your teams get better at their craft. Your investment in tools and practices help create an environment that attracts and retains top talent. This is all easier said than done, and in this 40 minute panel discussion Bill Higgins, IBM Distinguished Engineer, along with Jason Warner, SVP of Technology of GitHub, discuss concrete strategies for rolling out great tools at scale, including: choosing the right tools, finding and empowering user champions, enabling effective continuous learning (in the context of doing work), gaining the support of senior leadership.

As someone with Young Onset Parkinson's Disease, I'm personally familiar with how my working conditions, the attitudes of my colleagues, and my ability to disclose has affected the course of my disease. The theme of this talk is about how an empathetic, positive, and flexible work atmosphere is beneficial for people living with chronic disease, based on my personal account. Being productive and thriving at GitHub despite having Young Onset Parkinson's Disease has largely depended on working with empathetic people, but also the ability to work remotely, flexibility, and ultimately feel supported enough to disclose to those I work with. Companies can foster an atmosphere of trust that allows those dealing with chronic illness to self care, whether they choose to disclose or not.About GitHub Universe:GitHub Universe is a two-day conference dedicated to the creativity and curiosity of the largest software community in the world.

Maybe we studied some common code smells and learned about the things that we should be avoiding, but memorizing the rules doesn’t automatically lead to fixing all problems. In this talk, we explore how you can use GitHub to recognize and address violations to each of the SOLID principles. Using diffs, commit history and pull requests you can learn to recognize patterns in code that point to problems. These same tools can help you correct those issues and write more maintainable code.About GitHub Universe:GitHub Universe is a two-day conference dedicated to the creativity and curiosity of the largest software community in the world.

However, there are also selected privileges like religion, gender identity, and education.This session will teach attendees how to lend their privilege.

These different types of privilege lending will be illustrated through well known examples and concrete examples of how they can play out in the technology industry.About GitHub Universe:GitHub Universe is a two-day conference dedicated to the creativity and curiosity of the largest software community in the world.

If pull requests are used effectively with proper code review and your existing workflow, they can not only help ensure high quality of written code, but do so without sacrificing the speed of development. We'll start out by looking at what makes a great pull request, and what barriers people have with sending and receiving them. Next, we'll remove some of those barriers by discussing some code review best practices to ensure the code we're writing is well written and well tested. Lastly, we'll see how and why these pieces are a crucial part of a proper workflow, and what advantages the GitHub Flow has.About GitHub Universe:GitHub Universe is a two-day conference dedicated to the creativity and curiosity of the largest software community in the world.

You can create resources when you need and dispose of them when you don’t. Using Amazon CloudFormation you can describe your architecture in text files. To change your infrastructure, you edit those files. Having application and infrastructure code together in a single, robust, versioned repository like Git gives a lot of advantages. Using AWS Elastic Beanstalk you can link your Git branches to different infrastructure environments (e.g. test, production) and automate deployments. You can create test environments on-demand, even for a short time. Instead of continuously update your resources, you can recreate them quickly from scratch, simplifying lifecycle management and making deployments immutable.
