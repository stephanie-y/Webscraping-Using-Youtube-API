# Webscraping-Youtube-with-Python

Webscraping information on various channels using Google's Youtube API v3 and Python.

YouTube API makes webscraping very simple. The data collected can be extremely useful for analysis such as how video titles are related with number of views, most commonly used words in video titles, average playlist lengths and so on. 
I will be uploading various Python notebooks that show you how to gather data for your own projects!

**1) scraping-githubs-channel.ipynb:** This notebook shows you how to gather the title, description, and publish date of all videos of any YouTube channel. You can store this information into a csv, xlsx, or just keep it as a list of json data. The collected video ids can be used as a separate list to scrape the videos statistics of each video as well.

**2) get-video-info.ipynb:** This notebook shows you how to use the video id data gathered from the above notebook to grab YouTube statistics for each video id.

# Datasets:
